# SelfCare

**This project is part of George Brown College Capstone project. The project is embarked on by the "magnificent" coding trio with nothing in common, but the sheer desire to master and excel in the computer science discipline .**

## Motivation

This project was embarked on after a realization of a niche that presently exists in the market. Currently Toronto alone gets a good number (for lack of actual stats we shall say GAZILLION) of international scholars who come here with the intention of attaining a quality education. In the midst of this journey, an individual will need certain services which we refer to as self care. You want a haircut, where do you go. Who is the best barber ? Or are all barbers made **EQUAL** ? Hmmm .. And this right how was the problem we set out to fix. We wanted to give the enduser a chance to find the best hair dress, massage therapist, beautician, you name it. This would be done by giving the portential customer a reference point interms of a rating system. Here it should be noted that the professional is rated as an individual unlike most available sources that rate the establishment as a whole.

## Directory Structure
The project is divided by use of directory structure.
- documention -> this contains the documents created during the production phase
- reactNative -> this directory contains the react application which is the front end of the application.
      This application is written using React Native. This was chosen as it would allow us to develop for both Android and IOS at the same time.

## Running the Application
To run the application in development stage following commands can be used from the terminal (take note you have to "cd" into the react native folder):
  1. react-native run-ios
  2. react-native run-android
Please be aware that it will initial load of the application will take time.
