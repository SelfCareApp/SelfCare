<h5>This project is part of George Brown College Capstone project. The project is embarked on by the "magnificent" coding trio with nothing in common, but the sheer desire to master and excel in the computer science discipline .</h5>

The project is divided by use of directory structure.
- documention -> this contains the documents created during the production phase
- reactNative -> this directory contains the react application which is the front end of the application.
      This application is written using React Native. This was chosen as it would allow us to develop for both Android and IOS at the same time.

To run the application in development stage following commands can be used from the terminal (take note you have to "cd" into the react native folder):
  1. react-native run-ios
  2. react-native run-android
Please be aware that it will initial load of the application will take time.
